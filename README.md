# JavaScript Course
## Introduction
This repository is for my Tech Academy projects using JavaScript.  It will contain my work done as I progress through the course.
## Projects
During this course, I made numerous websites to practice the skills I learned.  Below is the code for a few of the larger ones:  

*[Simple Calculator](Calculator/calculator.html)  
A simple calculator that can perform basic mathematics.

*[Pizza Restaurant Menu](Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)  
An interactive pizza ordering website where the user can customize their pizza.

*[TicTacToe](TicTacToe/TicTacToe.html)  
A simple tictactoe game where the user competes against a computer opponent that selects a space randomly.
